# What is `NPM`?
npm is the world's largest software registry, hosting millions of packages. it is like a node package manager  [npm link](https://www.npmjs.com/)

# ``` üõ†Ô∏è How NPM Works: A Step-by-Step Guide üöÄ ```

1.Project Initialization: Developers kickstart a new project by running npm init in the project directory. This command generates a package.json file that acts as a manifest for the project, containing metadata and dependency information.

``` npm init 
```

2.Developers specify these dependencies in the package.json file and install them using the npm install command.

``` npm install lodash 
```
3.NPM automatically creates a node_modules directory where it stores the installed packages. These dependencies are recorded in the package.json file under the dependencies section.

```
"dependencies": {
  "lodash": "^4.17.21"
}
```
4.NPM uses semantic versioning to define package versions. Developers can specify version ranges in the package.json file to allow for flexibility in updating packages.

```
"dependencies": {
  "lodash": "^4.17.21"
}

```
5.The package-lock.json file provides specific version information for each package that is currently being used in a project.

```
{
  "name": "my-blog",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": {
      "version": "4.17.21",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash/-/lodash-4.17.21.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-...
      "dev": true
    }
  }
}
```

# What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acMkGVlT--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2kjt8k6fk0jjx6r53zdw.png">

`Parcel/Webpack` are the bundlers.
A web bundler is a tool or software utility used in web development whose primary purpose is to improve the performance of web applications.

### Command for installing the parcel bundler into our code
```
npm install -D parcel
```

# What is `.parcel-cache`
`.parcel-cache` is a directory generated by the Parcel bundler, serving as a cache for storing intermediate build results. It enhances the development workflow by speeding up subsequent builds and optimizing resource usage.

# What is `npx` ?
 
It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. 

# What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
1. `dependencies`:

   - The `dependencies` property is used to list the packages that are required for the project to run in a production or deployment environment.
   - These packages are necessary for the application's core functionality and are typically required at runtime.
   - When you install the project dependencies using `npm install`, the packages listed in the `dependencies` section are installed.

   Example:

```
   "dependencies": {
     "express": "^4.17.1",
     "lodash": "^4.17.21"
   }
   ```


2. `devDependencies`:
   - The `devDependencies` property is used to list the packages that are only required during development, such as testing frameworks, build tools, and development-specific utilities.
   - These packages are not necessary for the application to run in a production environment but are helpful during development and testing phases.
   - When you install the project dependencies along with dev dependencies using `npm install`, the packages listed in both the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections are installed.

   Example:
```
   "devDependencies": {
     "mocha": "^9.0.3",
     "nodemon": "^2.0.13"
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

To summarize, `dependencies` includes packages needed for the application to run in a production environment, while `devDependencies` includes packages required during development and testing but are not necessary for the production deployment.



# What is `Tree Shaking`?
Tree shaking refers to dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process.

When we import and export modules in JavaScript, most of the time there is unused code floating around. Excluding that unused code (also referred as dead code) is called tree shaking.

Utilizing the tree shaking and dead code elimination can significantly reduce the code size we have in our application. The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be.

# What is `Hot Module Replacement`?
Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) is one of the most useful features offered by webpack. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh

# What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
A .gitignore file tells Git which files (or patterns) it should ignore and not track. This is useful to prevent certain files from being added to version control, which can help reduce repository size and avoid committing sensitive or unnecessary files.

The files which are re-generate with our existing code are mostly not added to out code like 
node_modules/ 
dist/
.parcel_cache


# What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
`package.json`
Purpose: It is the primary configuration file for a Node.js project. It defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

Content:
* Metadata: Information about the project such as name, version, description, and author.
* Dependencies: Lists the packages your project depends on under the dependencies and devDependencies sections.
* Scripts: Defines scripts that can be run using npm run <script-name>, such as start, test, and build.
```
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  }
}

```

# Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

# What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
node_modules is a folder which stores external dependencies of the project. Whenever we install some external package through ‚Äúnpm‚Äù or ‚Äúyarn‚Äù in a project locally, it gets stored into the node_modules folder located at the root of the project directory by default. It is not a idea to put in git because 
- it is very large in size
- it is regenerative module(with the information of package.json and package-lock.json we can again install node_modules by using the command `npm install`) 
- so,it not good idea to push into the git

# What is the `dist` folder?
The dist folder is often used to store the final output of your build process. This includes the compiled, minified, or otherwise processed files that are ready for `distribution` or `deployment`.

# What is `browserlists`
browserslist allows you to specify which browsers your project should support. This helps ensure that your code is compatible with the browsers used by your target audience and can be optimized accordingly.

### Example package.json Configuration
```
{
  "browserslist": [
    "> 1%",
    "last 2 versions",
    "Firefox ESR",
    "not dead"
  ]
}

```
